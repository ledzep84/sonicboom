Back in the days when SonicWall is not supporting upload<br>
of multiple ip addresses at once; you have to create hosts<br>
one by one.

Imagine creating 200+ host using GUI.

This code tries to simplify the task by spitting out prepared<br>
syntax with your 200+ IP addresses. All you need to do after<br>
providing those IP addresses is to copy and paste the<br>
generated configuration.

You need to have a CLI access to your firewall in order to<br>
get the benefit of this script.

Requirements: Python 2.7, Kali Linux<br>
